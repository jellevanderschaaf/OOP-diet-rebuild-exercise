Trying to rebuild the architecture behind my main project to match the object oriented style of programming.

Goals / planning:

- Create a food item array containing one food item class.
- Start out with a few hand typed objects.
- Create a "new food item" menu that allows adding new objects and pushes them to the food item array.
- Acces data from the array and display it.
